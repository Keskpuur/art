									        <p>I depict a building that has been worn down by time and people.
											   I have scraped and studied the walls, ceilings and floors to discover what once was there. 
											   Who lived there? What drove the changes in their surroundings? Why was it abandoned?
											<p>The building is now under the care of new people. Near the entrance, there are hoses 
												pumping water out from under the floor. Where it's possible to walk, one must be cautious 
												of protruding nails and sharp objects. In the midst of all this, the period of time when 
												the situation will improve feels overwhelming. </p>
											<p>At the edge of the surrounding chaos, an empty armchair has been place. </p>
											<p>Through conversations the artists have found the act of painting itself to be an opportunity to step back and recharge. 
												Painting can provide the opportunity to communicate and at the same time allows the artists to create their own “cocoons” 
												to set the boundaries and to feel contained. Having a sense of overwhelm and decision fatigue due to the chaotic nature 
												of the endless amount of choices surrounding us, the artists have returned to painting. 
												The act that can serve as a bridge to upcoming solutions. 
												The works created for this exhibition serve as a reminder that a retreat place is often closer than we think.</p>
