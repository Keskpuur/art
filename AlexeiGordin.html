										<p>“Yesterday's”/ Eilne”</p>
                                        
									        <p>“Yesterday's” is a new site-specific painting installation by Alexei Gordin
												located in the heart of the Central Market, a nostalgic place, a sanctuary
												 of an old time of transition when capitalism was just a baby in post-Soviet
												  territories. In the nineties, markets became training grounds for nascent
												   market-based relationships, often associated with criminality and a certain 
												   danger. “Yesterday's” is an absurd pun reflecting the artist's thoughts about 
												   contemporaneity, nostalgia, and the place of art within it. Tallinn Central
												    Market will soon be renovated into a trendy contemporary marketplace, losing
													its old-fashioned authenticity and the last signs of perestroika aesthetics. 
													Everything new, nevertheless, becomes nostalgic after a long time passes. We
													live in constant change, and art is something that tries to stop and dissect 
													particular narratives in time. However, art itself, like any other human creation, 
													often needs to be studied and dissected. In his installation, Gordin refers to a 
													famous painting by Ed Ruscha, where, on a reddish background, it is written 
													“Artists who make pieces.” The word "piece" is associated with something incomplete, 
													cut, and imperfect; thus, art seems to lose its elitist, sacral meaning, becoming 
													equivalent to a “piece of meat” or even a “piece of shit.” This is also how capitalism 
													works: it divides our will and desires into many small pieces, preventing us 
													from perceiving the whole. Throughout history, the market has been not only 
													a place for buying goods but also an important communication platform. Recent 
													developments are showing us that shopping areas are noticeably winning over 
													communication platforms. What will be the role of art on the periphery of these 
													changes? Let's hope that these fears are unfounded. In the same time, nostalgia is 
													not such an innocent thing, always making us dream about a “beautiful yesterday” 
													instead of creating a better tomorrow.</p>
