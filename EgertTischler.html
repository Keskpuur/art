										<p>"I was driving to Keskturg and right before arriving there, 
											two Hooded Crows flew towards each other, crossing right in the center of the road,
											forming a symmetrical gate-like pattern. I felt that I was welcomed."</p>
									        <p>“If you were a bird, then which one?”</p>
									        <p>Keskturg has been haunted by several dark events that took place during the 90s, 
											including bomb explosions and gun violence. The main cause of these events was
											the conflict in which farmers attempted to sell cheaper goods and refused to pay 
											protection money to racketeers of Keskturg, leading to numerous killings. According 
											to the Police and the Border Guard Agency, one million kroons (Estonian currency at the time) 
											of illicit funds passed through Keskturg each day, all of which were eventually laundered.</p>
									        <p>The exhibition “Gatekeepers” explores the inherent vulnerability and fragile nature of human beings.
											Human existence is closely connected to their interactions with others, they form complex social
											structures, ranging from families and communities to larger societies. When individuals exhibit
											territorial behavior, especially in the context of property and personal space, they are taught
											to secure resources, protect offspring, and ensure survival. However, certain aspects of territorial
										        behavior can become problematic or potentially dangerous. The issue arises when individuals direct their
											attention towards a specific group or person. They develop an ideology centered on vilifying their 
											opposition, employing words and actions to rally others to their cause. Eventually, they create a 
											redoubtable collective force, surpassing the power of any single individual and attempting to take 
											everything away from their opposition.</p>
									        <p>“Gatekeepers” deals with these topics by drawing parallels with archetypes, more precisely with birds and 
											takes a playful approach with its anecdotal installations and paintings. The artist takes a step outside
											the classical canvas by painting bird droppings in public space, pushing boundaries between street art 
											and painting.</p>
									        <p>Egert Tischler (1994) is a multidisciplinary artist who graduated from the Estonian Academy of Arts painting BA
											and is currently doing his MA in Contemporary Art. His work has lately  been site-specific and has evolved 
											through mixing classical painting techniques and street art.</p>
