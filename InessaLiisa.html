										<p>“Before I forget, there’s something I’d like to get off my chest”</p>
                                        
									        <p>Wish we could always recognize the good and the important before it becomes something we talk about in
                                                 the past. Before it becomes something to look back upon. And not be afraid of something passing, 
                                                 before it has even begun.</p>
									        <p>Inessa Saarits` and Liisa-Lota Jõeleht’s exhibition is a room installation that tries to turn the cold
                                                 Keskpuur gallery into something warm and domestic. A place that remembers, keeps in mind and longs for
                                                  something. Attempting to keep its surroundings alive as long as there is something to look after.</p>
									        <p>Inessa Saarits (2000) is mostly interested in natural and time-changing materials — peat, soil, jelly, 
                                                and mushrooms. She deals with the relationship between human and nature and uses public space and
                                                 performative elements in her practice.
                                                She is studying installation and sculpture at the Estonian Academy of Arts and has furthered her 
                                                education at the Vienna Academy of Arts. Inessus is part of the art groups ENKKL and TEMA and is a 
                                                founding member of the youth art event "Kunstikompott". She has participated in several group 
                                                exhibitions and created performances and installations together with TEMA in Tartu, Tallinn, Pärnu,
                                                 and Viljandi.</p>
									        <p>Liisa-Lota Jõeleht is interested in the romanticization of the mundane as well as the ordinary
                                                 and average parts of it. In her practice she looks for visual parallels for every day feelings
                                                  and thoughts in organic materials and waste.
                                                She is currently studying in the installation and sculpture department at the Estonian Academy 
                                                of Arts and has furthered her education at the University of Bergen . She is part of the Estonian
                                                 Young Contemporary Art Union (ENKKL). Jõeleht has participated in group exhibitions in Tallinn, 
                                                 Tartu, Võru and Bergen.</p>
